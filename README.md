# ResponsivePortfolio

This is a responsive portfolio website built using bootstrap and bootstrap grid.

## To do:

- drop down menu doesn't work for mobile version

- sizing of container is weird and i'm not sure why (purple box)

- how to vertically center about me photo

- how to size all the pictures the same in portfolio (attempted to use own pictures from a past portfolio but oof)

- how to space things in footer, first link won't change color

- want to tab what's under contact

- html validation service ?

- am i using semantic right ?

## It does have the following:

- a functional navbar that is consistent on each page and has working links

- contains Ella's personalized information (about me page, portfolio photos)

- a functional website renders well on multiple devices

- i believe it has a sticky footer
